## Create a form using express and mongodb 
dependencies :: ejs , express , mongoose
npm init -y :: package.json
npm i express
npm i mongoose
npm i ejs
ejs is for view
mongoose is for db
In this appn. , we are creating or making logic and views at server side which is not good practice and due to this limitation developers used react.js / vue.js / angular.js
connection.js file is must to connect server with db
Distributed Application :: 4 main folders
- views :: for view ( html , css ) , extn -> .ejs of files
- models :: to create table
- routes :: make api's (routes)
- controller :: for business logic
  Routes are used to make/do CRUD operations using GET ( send data to server ) , POST ( create data ) , PUT ( update data ) , DELETE ( remove data )
